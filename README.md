# jekyllopendata.site
This site supplements a workshop given on Open Data Day 2020 in Edmonton. Check out the code or the [site](https://jekyllopendata.site) to see different ways Jekyll can be used with open data. 

Note that the Google maps API_key will not work (in config.yml). The map will not appear in the current site. You will have to get your own API key and switch it in. See directions on doing that [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key)
